About Erasmus for Entrepreneurs</h2> The Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs program will support you in starting your business, for example in becoming a freelance developer, and to develop relevant skills for managing and expanding your own business. You will be working together with
      a local host entrepreneur (so for example with layerJS). The duration of the stay abroad can be between one and six months. The European Union provides financial support to the new entrepreneurs for their stay abroad.
      <br>
      <br> In order to become funded by the program you will need to provide a business plan describing the business you intend to start, for example a web development company. Please note: You are not required to eventually found or continue that company
      if you don't want or can't. You also don't have to start your business in Germany. This is an unique opportunity to find out, whether an own business is an option for you. And it is even funded. No strings attached.
      <br>
      <br> Once accepted you will be able to connect to host entrepreneurs from different EU countries. Of course we would be super happy if you choose to make your first entrepreneurial experience in our team. You can definitely get in touch with us before
      you start your Erasmus application and we may be able to support you with the application.
